/* also change contain from id to class maybe */
/* IDEA make it so all css properties are changed within js and change 
property values to the corresponding needs. example: change :nth-child(16n + 1) 
js loop conditional i < 257 to (21n + 1) and i < 442 */


/* remove as much css as possible and make put everythig in relation to the grid in
js and connect to a slider */
